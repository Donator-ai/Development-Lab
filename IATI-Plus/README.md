Donator's humanitarian crowdfunding platform is powered by our lab's **IATI Plus** graph database.

**IATI** is an XML standard and open data sharing framework that's widely used across the humanitarian community, managed by the **Internatioinal Aid Transparency Initiative**. Donator maintains a live, fully up-to-date clone of IATI's entire corpus.
