# IATI Plus Database Fields

IATI is an XML standard and open data sharing framework widely used across the humanitarian community. **IATI Plus** is a cloned version of IATI's entire corpus, with added non-IATI standard fields incorporated into the database. 

## Previous Work

## Current Work

We are currently mapping IATI's entire coprus and rebuilding and reformatting our list of fields
